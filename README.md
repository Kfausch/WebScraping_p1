This project is an example of how to use selenium to pull data from a website. I recommend commenting out the Chrome Options if you don't want Chrome to stay open.

Make sure to import/install Pandas, Matplotlib, Selenium, and Webdriver-Manager

Dealing with driver compatibility can be tricky. Make sure the driver you are referencing and selenium are both up to date.

The specific example here is going to a Witcher Wiki site to see if we can pull all the character names, categorize them by the book they showed up in,
and chart how many characters were referenced in each book.

With this basic script you can change out the starting URL and update element names so this can be done on other websites.

You can also take it a step further by stepping into the character, collecting their Basic Information, and chart off that data as well.
